A simplistic Patch Creator for modified files

I always end up copying over files from different directories and need these files in other dirs or other systems. Think of modifying a few files and then sending them over to a friend. Problem? Your friend doesn't know which file goes in which directory.

I decided to write a simple application for solving this common problem I face. At the moment, the patch would be a zip file containing the folder structure as well. This could evolve to be something pretty useful if I get time to make it more than a simple patcher.
